# NFC Mifare Ultralight example

This app reads and writes data to NXP's Mifare Ultralight tag. It is tested with the Ultralight C and Ultralight EV1 type so 
I cannot guarantee that it works on the other type also.

The Mifare Ultralight family consists of 3 main subtypes:

1) Mifare Ultralight: Get the datasheet MF0ICU1 here: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF0ICU1.pdf
2) Mifare Ultralight C: Get the datasheet here MF0ICU2: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF0ICU2.pdf
3) Mifare Ultralight EV1: Get the datasheet here: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF0ULX1.pdf

All datasheets are available in the docs folder of this repository but it is always better to get one from the origin source.

As some parts of the software where "copy & paste" from Mifare Classic Tool (MCT) the license of this   
app is the same as the one for MCT:
